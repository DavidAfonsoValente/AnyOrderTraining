# Scheduled Masking Experiment Configuration
# Gradually increases masking probability during training

# Inherit from base config
_base_: ../base_config.yaml

# Override specific settings
masking:
  strategy: "cell"
  mask_prob: 0.15  # Initial probability
  mask_obs: true
  mask_act: true
  mask_schedule: "linear"  # Options: 'linear', 'cosine', 'step'
  schedule_start_prob: 0.15
  schedule_end_prob: 0.50
  schedule_steps: 10000  # Number of steps to reach end probability
  
  cell_masking:
    mask_all_attributes: true

experiment:
  name: "scheduled_masking_linear_015_050"
  tags: ["scheduled-masking", "curriculum"]
  notes: "Cell-level masking with linear schedule from 15% to 50% over 10k steps. Curriculum learning approach."

# Curriculum learning rationale:
# - Start with easier task (less masking)
# - Gradually increase difficulty
# - May lead to better convergence and generalization
